ΣΕΝ might be written instead of ΕΠΟΙΕΣΕΝ. For ·-··

was ever used hythe Greeks without the l subjoyued

beenan extravagant wantonuess to intend, that the
letter E in ΣΙΓΕΙΕΣ should be pronounced El, when
this very power is in the preceding syllable ex-
pressed in full. You meet. with nothing similar in
the use of O.

Another authority referred to in your Commen-
tary is the Delion Inscription. To this 1 objected‚
that the inscription was AEolic, and that, therefore,
