trax. Greeks was sometimes pronounced Eltand asaprool

-- of this you appeal to EMI iu the Delian inscription
But this amounts tono proof, unless it bc impossible
that EMI iu that inscription should have any other
power than ΕΙΜΙ. Whereas 1 have assigned another
power indisputably possible, nay highly probahle, or
rather certainly true.

Lastly, if the Delion Inscriptiou be, as 1 maintaio, ¹
AEolic, ’tis plain, that your account of dialects aod
archaism is not applicable to it. By your account, l
the distinction of dialects, as far as relates to the
powers ημ and ειμι, did not take place, till the ohs- i
racter H was introduced. But, according to my
explicatior, we have iu this inscription the power

329 ημι in the * form εμι. So that your notiou of archaisn
and mine of dialects are not found to coincide.

l am preparing for the press a volume in tbe
critical way, (which l shall desire the favour of you
to revise) with the following inscription: Emenda-
tioaes ia Poetas Groecos, Aristophanem, Euripidem, y
Sophoclem, AEschylum, Callimachum, Theocritum '¹
Pindarum, Hesiodum, Homerum. Praemittitur dtr- ‚
